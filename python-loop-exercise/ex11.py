- Exercise 11: Print all prime numbers within a range
- Note: 
- - A Prime Number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1 without remainders (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).
- - A Prime Number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers.

- Examples:
6 is not a prime number because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply to make it.

- Given:
# range
start = 25
end = 50

- Expected output:
Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
29
31
37
41
43
47
